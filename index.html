              <p>Bunnie loves hardware. He loves to make it, and to break it; he loves the smell of it. His passion for hardware began in elementary school, and since then he has garnered a PhD at MIT in EE, and has designed nanophotonic silicon chips, wireless radios, consumer electronics, robotic submarines, among other things. He was involved in some of the earliest stages of hardware reverse engineering on the Xbox, and his experiences are summarized in his book, "Hacking the Xbox: An Introduction to Reverse Engineering". bunnie believes hardware is delightful in part because there are no secrets in hardware; you just need a better microscope. Likewise, he is a proponent of open source hardware, and is an active contributor to the ecosystem. At chumby, he designed several open source hardware platforms, some of which had found its way to the shelves of retailers around the world. bunnie is also an educator; he serves as a Research Affiliate for the MIT Media Lab, technical advisor for several hardware startups and MAKE magazine, and shares his experiences manufacturing hardware in China through his blog.</p>
              <p>In 2012 he received an Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award for his work in hardware hacking, open source and activism. He currently lives in Singapore.</p>

              <p>He grew up and went to school in San Diego, California. At university, to an administrative quirk, the school of computing was unavailable, so he earned a degree in cognitive science instead, because people are like squishy computers, right?</p>
              <p>After university, he got a job working at chumby Industries, where he met Bunnie. There, he got his first shot at creating low level device firmware, and figuring out how to create computers from scratch. He did much the firmware for the chumby One.</p>

              <p>Before co-founding ViSenze, Oliver held senior roles at PT Media Nusantara Citra (MNC - Indonesia’s largest multimedia company) and at MediaCorp where he led in strategy and business development, partnerships, web analytics and ad ops for Interactive Media. In 2009, he was instrumental in establishing XinMSN, one of Singapore’s largest entertainment portals. Before that, he spent 5 eventful years in an award-winning web security startup (until its successful buyout) where he rolled his sleeves and led in all aspects of its corporate, business,market development as well as group ops management across 3 countries. At e-Cop, he helped the then young company become EBITDA positive within 3 years of operations and nailed a series of achievements. Oliver started his early years in venture capital in IndoChina before progressing to executing M&amp;A projects for Pacific Internet (now PacNet), Singapore Telecom(SingTel) and MediaCorp in his later years, collectively completing more than a dozen multi-million dollar deals in between.</p>
              <p>Smitten by so much fun from his prior 5 years experience in a startup, Oliver decided to leave a successful corporate career of over 15 years in 2013 to go back to his first true love - tech startups !! – by becoming one himself together. As the founding CEO of ViSenze, a pioneer startup in intelligent visual recognition and search - he rolls up his shelve again to helm ViSenze, with goal of becoming a global leader in visual tech space. In 2013, he led the company to partner Rakuten to launch the region’s first ever visual-search driven ecommerce site in Taiwan. Subsequently in Feb 2014, he led ViSenze to close its first major funding of US$3.5 million (Series A) from marque investors, including Rakuten. A passionate start-up believer, Oliver is driven by making a difference in things he does, and so shares his experience willingly, having crossed from corporate to startup twice.</p>
              <p>Oliver earned his bachelor’s degree with honours in economics and MBA with distinction from Royal Holloway, University of London. In his free time, he trains for marathons and enjoys cycling.</p>
